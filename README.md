Crowdfunding Analysis Project

Overview

Welcome to the Crowdfunding Analysis project! This Excel project provides a comprehensive analysis of crowdfunding campaigns. It includes features such as conditional formatting, formula-based calculations, pivot tables, and charts to help users derive meaningful insights from their crowdfunding data.

Instructions

Conditional Formatting for Outcome Column

Apply conditional formatting to the Outcome column. Each cell is filled with a different color based on the campaign's status: successful, failed, canceled, or live.

Percent Funded Column
Create a new column named Percent Funded using a formula to calculate the percentage of money a campaign made relative to its initial funding goal. Apply conditional formatting to this column using a three-color scale.

Average Donation Column

Create the Average Donation column using a formula to find the average amount paid by each project backer.

Parent Category and Sub-Category Columns

Create two new columns, Parent Category and Sub-Category, by splitting the existing Category and Sub-Category columns using formulas.
Pivot Tables and Charts

Add a new sheet with a pivot table analyzing the initial worksheet to count the number of successful, failed, canceled, and live campaigns per category.
Create a stacked-column pivot chart allowing filtering by country based on the table created.
Add another sheet containing a pivot table analyzing the initial sheet to count the number of campaigns per sub-category. Create a stacked-column pivot chart with filters for country and parent category.

Date Conversion

Create two new columns, Date Created Conversion and Date Ended Conversion, using a formula to convert Unix timestamps into Excel's date format.

Time Series Analysis

Add a new sheet with a pivot table analyzing outcomes over time with columns for outcome, rows for Date Created Conversion, values based on the count of outcomes, and filters based on parent category and years.
Create a pivot-chart line graph to visualize this new table.

Microsoft Word Report

Generate a report in Microsoft Word to answer questions based on the analysis, drawing conclusions, discussing dataset limitations, and suggesting additional tables or graphs.
